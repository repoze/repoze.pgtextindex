0.5 (2012-04-27)
================

- Switched to read committed isolation and removed explicit locking.
  The explicit locking was reducing write performance and may have been
  interfering with autovacuum.  This change raises the probability
  of temporary inconsistency, but since this package did not provide
  ACID compliance anyway, developers already need to be prepared for
  temporary inconsistency.


0.4 (2011-11-18)
================

- Truncate text to 1MB per document in order to stay under (silly) limit
  imposed by PostgreSQL.


0.3 (2011-06-30)
================

- Fixed PostgreSQL ProgrammingError when query string contains a backslash
  character.  (LP #798725)

- Added ability to mark content with arbitrary markers which can be used as
  discriminators at query time.  (LP #792334)

- Support searches for words containing an apostrophe.  (LP #801265)


0.2 (2011-06-15)
================

- Reworked the scoring method: added a per-document score coefficient.
  The score coefficient can boost the score of documents known to be
  trustworthy.

- Added the IWeightedText interface.  The discriminator function can
  return an IWeightedText instance to control the weights and
  coefficient.

- Added the IWeightedQuery interface.  Text index queries can
  pass an IWeightedQuery instance to control the weight values.

- Allow persistent objects to be indexed, since the usual objection
  (accidental ZODB references) does not apply.

- Do not drop and create the table by default, making PGTextIndex
  easier to use outside ZODB.

- Added the 'get_contextual_summaries' and 'get_contextual_summary'
  methods to the index.

- Compatability with repoze.catalog 0.8.0.


0.1 (2011-01-20)
================

- Initial release.
